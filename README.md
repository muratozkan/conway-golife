# Scala & Akka & Game of Life 

A very na√Øve implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** in *Scala & Akka*.

Currently, every cell is implemented as an actor. *World* actor will coordinate the cells and the results will be pushed to *Gui* Actor. Console inputs are used to control the simulation.

Dependencies will automatically be downloaded with activator.

### Available Features

* Simulation :)

### Planned

* Simulation :)
* Many cells per actor (to decrease actor processing overhead)
* Distributed calculation
* Turkish README
* Unit Tests
